:: Go to the bathroom.

:: Use toilet.
You consider using the toilet. However, at a second glance, you realize it not designed for someone of your little stature. The bowl is almost twice your size, and you could easily fall in. Based on the size, you presume that this house is owned by a family of rhinoceroses, or maybe big horses.

You didn't really need to pee anyway.

:: Leave the bathroom.
You go back into the hallway. The loud music continues to bombard your ears. That didn't really help much.

* [[Go outside.]]
* [[Return to the foyer.|The Foyer.]]
