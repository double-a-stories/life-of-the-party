<!-- Planned route:
You get extremely drunk in the living room, and black out. You awake to find two black cat siblings (Nikki & Nox) have dragged your unconscious body into the broom closet.

They're vore voyeurs, and try to talk you into eating a micro.
-->

:: Get very very drunk. [dark drunk]
You decide to grab one more cup of spiked punch, and shudder as you swallow the contents of the cup.

As you do, you begin to feel slightly off-balance, as if the room is spinning. You stagger back from the table like an exaggerated cartoon depiction of a drunk person.

Surprisingly, being drunk feels pretty good. You feel ready to take on the world! Ready to finally become the extroverted social butterfly you were always meant to be.

You slick your ears back behind your head, and confidently stride back into the party. And then...

Uh...

* [[What?|Drunk route bullshit]]

:: Drunk route bullshit [dark drunk]
Your name is Hollis Freeley. You are an androgynous gray rabbit.

You remember drinking a fifth cup of punch, probably five more than your tiny rabbit body could handle. Then you went back onto the dance floor... It's kind of a blur after that?

You remember streaks of light and sound. Black fur. You can't quite make heads or tails of it, although you're pretty sure there were a lot of heads and tails there.

Your name is Hollis Freeley. You have blacked out.

* [[Where am I now?]]

:: Where am I now? [dark drunk]
You're at a very crowded house party. Or, you were. But maybe you're somewhere else now?

Right now you're lying flat on your back. Your stomach feels a little gross, and your eyes are shut tightly. A few feet away is a stainless steel oven, fridge, and dishwasher, complimented by a midcentury modern marble countertop.

You're on the floor of the kitchen. What will you do?

* [[Get up.|Wake up in the kitchen.]]

:: Wake up in the kitchen. [checkpoint]
*CW: Player pred. Sadism. Unwilling pred. Micro prey. Violent coercion.*

"Ooh! They're waking up!" says a voice.

"Quiet," says another voice.

Your ears twitch, and you groan as you slowly sit up. A warm fluorescent lightbulb blasts you in the eyes. Lying beside you is a pile of plastic cups, a jumbo bag of vegan pretzels, and a silicon horse dildo.

Two identical black cats are hovering over you expectantly, their tails wiggling with interest.

* [[Wh-who are you guys?]]

:: Wh-who are you guys?
<% s.knowNikkiNoxNames = true; %>

"Oh, how rude of us! I'm Nox, and she's Nikki!" says the first cat.

"I'm Nikki, he's Nox," repeats the other cat.

You're still too hungover to try and tell them apart, but you nod.

"A pleasure to make your acquaintance," says Nikki.

* [[What happened?]]

:: What happened?
Both cats give you a genial smile. "You don't remember?" asks Nox, scratching his fur nervously.

You shake your head.

Nikki clears her throat. "Well, Hollis, the short version is that you got totally, extremely sloshed, and passed out on the floor for about an hour."

* [[How do you know my name?]]

:: How do you know my name?
"Oh," says Nox, "this is kind of awkward, but you actually said it, like, four times. You kept on insisting, 'I am Hollis Freeley!'"

You feel your cheeks flush with embarassment.

"Anyway," Nikki continues, "you danced a little, then ran around for a while flirting with preds."

"And er, you took off your shirt at one point!"

* [[Oh jeez...]]

:: Oh jeez...
Nox chimes in, "A couple of the jocks tried to take a lick, but this labrador guy was really insistent that 'None of you dudes try and take advantage of this little rabbit dude in their inebriated state, kay dudes?'"

Nikki continues, "Afterwards, you stumbled into the kitchen, grabbed even more booze and snacks, and fell asleep. And here you are now."

"We've been watching you ever since," Nox says, smiling, "Just to make sure you didn't die, or anything!"

* [[...And the dildo?]]

:: ...And the dildo?
All three of your look down at the flared 14-incher lying limply at your feet. The cats exchange a glance.

"...I actually have no idea where you got that from," says Nikki.

You rise to your feet, dusting some pretzel crumbs off your back.


* [[You're not gonna eat me, are you?]]

:: You're not gonna eat me, are you?
"Oh, no!" says Nox, "You're way too big!"

Nikki adds, "Besides, my sibling and I don't much fancy ourselves predators, per se..."

Nox pipes in, "We prefer to think of ourselves as encouraging observers!"

"In fact, while we're on the subject, we have an... interesting proposition for you," says Nikki, runnning her paw gently up your arm.

Your mouth goes dry.

* [[Well I'm flattered, but...]]

:: Well I'm flattered, but...
 Nox immediately blurts out, "It's not sex!"

Nikki shoots him a look.

"Sorry, it sounded like we were talking about sex. Which we're not."

* [[Wh-what is it then?]]

:: Wh-what is it then?
"Glad you asked," says Nikki, "Nox, if you will?"

Nox reaches into his front pockets and produces a brown dwarf mouse. She struggles for balance as she stands on his paw, and squints at the sudden exposure to light.

A mouse? you ask.

"A meal." Nikki smiles.

"A morsel!" Nox beams.

* [[You want me to eat her??]]

:: You want me to eat her??
Nikki nods.

Nox says, "We figured that since you're feeling sauced and snacky, you'd enjoy feeling this lovely lady wriggling down your throat!"

"Not to mention, our little friend here is perfectly and completely willing." Nikki shoots a glare at the mouse in Nox's paws. "Isn't that right."

<q.mouse>Yes, that's right!</q> the mouse replies with a forced smile.

You look nervously at the tiny mouse. She looks back at you hopefully.

* [[Oh, um, I don't... do that.]]

:: Oh, um, I don't... do that.
But you're not a predator, you say. You don't eat people. Nor eggs, fish, or dairy, for that matter.

"Of course you don't," says Nikki, "That's actually why we're so interested."

Nox smirks, "There's nothing quite the thrill of like watching someone's first time!"

"Especially you herbivores! You get so conflicted and twisted up over it..." Nikki adds, betraying her own excitement with a blush.

"Why not give it a try?" asks Nox, bringing the brown mouse up to your paws, "A small, vulnerable thing like you may not get another chance before someone snatches *you* up!"

* [[Examine mouse.]]

:: Examine mouse.
You hold your paws flat, and the brown mouse dutifully walks from Nikki's paws onto yours. She keeps her hands folded nervously behind her back, as she continues to smile with only her teeth.

You haven't really seen such a small person up close before. Unsurprisingly, tinyfolk (that is, very small anthros) tend not to spend very much time around bigger folk, who could accidentally crush them with a single misstep.

You've also lived your whole life as a small, weak thing. Is it wrong to feel morbidly intrigued by the thought of devouring something even smaller and weaker? Devouring... Swallowing... Digesting... Hm.

For just a second, your mind races with images of yourself as a predator. You catch yourself looking down at the tiny mouse as an object, rather than a person. You see her tiny body tremble slightly in your paw, and your stomach ties in knots.

* [[H-hello there, I'm Hollis.]]

:: H-hello there, I'm Hollis.
You introduce yourself to the mouse.

<q.mouse>H-hi!</q> says the brown mouse, glancing at Nikki, as if asking for permission to speak. <q.mouse>I'm Faith.</q> <% if (s.rescuedKaia) { %> The name sounds familiar. You try to remember where you heard it, but everything from the last hour is too much of a blur.<% } %>

You ask Faith if she wants to be eaten.

Faith swallows and says, <q.mouse>Yup, haha!!</q> while looking halfway over her shoulder. <q.mouse>Totally!</q> You're pretty sure you get the picture.

* [[I won't do it!]]

:: I won't do it!
You say you refuse to participate in something so barbaric as devouring a helpless mouse against her will.

Nox seems disappointed. "Well, I guess there was always a possibility you'd say no. We can't force you, after all!"

Nikki snatches Faith back out of your paws, causing her to let out a startled squeak. The cat examines her coldly, and muses, "I suppose there are other ways we could have our fun with them..."

Your eyes go wide, as you recall several news stories of people doing hideous, awful things to micros, but not getting caught for lack of evidence.

* [[You mean like torture??]]

:: You mean like torture??
Nikki looks back to you, "Well, torture is such a strong word..."

That's horrible! you say.

"Well," Nox says, "my sister can be a little intense with her food. But that's only if you decide not to partake yourself!"

* [[I thought you said you weren't predators!]]

:: I thought you said you weren't predators!
