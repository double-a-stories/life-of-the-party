:: Go outside. [checkpoint]
You walk outside and down the steps onto the back porch. It's quiet out here.

You see a large hyena sitting on a garden bench, next to a disused charcoal grill and some rumpled up camping equipment. She looks to be a little older than you, and way, way taller.

There's also another bench a little further into the yard.
