:: Go outside. [checkpoint]
You walk out the side door, and down the steps into the backyard. It's quiet out here, finally.

You see a large hyena sitting on a garden bench, next to a disused charcoal grill and some rumpled up camping equipment. She looks to be a little older than you, and way, way taller.

There's also another bench a little further into the yard.
