<% setup.handleBroomCloset() %>

You enter the broom closet.

<div style="min-height: 6em" id="broom-closet-text">
Inside is a shelf with some towels, linens, and some cleaning supplies. Leaning against the wall is a broom and a vacuum cleaner.
</div>

\> <a0 id="broom-closet-link" data-passage="Upstairs Hallway">Go back to the hallway.</a>

<div-></div>

After wasting an inordinate amount of time doing absolutely nothing, you rationally decide that yes, it is now finally time to leave the broom closet.

You turn to the door and reach for the handle, only to realize that there isn't one. The broom closet only opens from the outside. Whoever designed this tiny, pointlesss room apparently did not expect that anyone would ever be stupid enough to walk inside and close the door behind them.

You're trapped, numb-nuts. I didn't even know that was possible.

You bang on the door trying to get someone's attention, but with the loud music going on downstairs, no one can hear you. As a result of this incredibly stupid turn of events, you remain trapped in the broom closet for the rest of the night. Congrats, I guess, on finding the dumbest ending ever.

### Game Over.

Sure, why not.

Elsewhere in the house, the morning sun comes blazing through the windows, and lands warmly on the cream-colored fur of a horse, lying in bed while her boyfriend snores loudly next to her. Lacey Armstrong stretches and yawns as she climbs out of bed, her guts filled with the digested remains of a guinea pig. Specifically, the remains of your friend, a guinea pig named Reese.

Lacey enters the hallway, and opens the broom closet to grab some clean bedsheets. She blinks groggily, as her brain takes a moment to register the unexpected presence of a gray rabbit, curled up and sleeping on the floor.

She laughs. "Wait a minute, is that... Hollis?"

\> [[Hollis: Wake up.]]


:: Hollis: Wake up. [morning] {"position":"1229,2228","sizing":"100,100"}
You squint your eyes, woken up by the blinding light streaming in from outside. You slowly and look up at the horse, who is beaming at you with a big smile. "Hey there! Remember me? It's Lacey, from Calc II!"

Instinctually, you try to leap to your feet and escape, but Lacey lightly places a foot (er, hoof, actually) on your stomach, keeping you in place.

"Sorry, can't have you running off now. Usually I'd appreciate some breakfast, but I'm kinda full right now..."

You breathe a sigh of relief, as you realize she's not going to eat you. Then, you hear a German shepherd come out into the hall, wearing nothing but his boxers. "Hey Lacey," he says rubbing his eyes, "who ya talking to?"

Lacey smirks as the dog notices you, and says, "...My *boyfriend* on the other hand, would absolutely *love* a taste!"

#### The End.
